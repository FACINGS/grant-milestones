* **Milestone Number:** 3

**Context:**
For execution of Milestone 3

**Deliverables:**

### Overview of the smart contract's functionalities:

- Domain Registration: Allows users to register unique domain names on EVMNS.
- Domain Management: Enables users to manage their registered domain names, such as changing the domain's profile,
  changing the resolver, modifying TLS certificates, and more.
- Domain Transfer: Allows users to transfer their registered domain names to others.
- Resolver Registration: Allows users to select a resolver to interpret the domain name. Depending on the resolver, the
  domain name can support different functions.
- Domain Resolution: Allows users or third-party dApps to query the profile content of any EVMNS domain name, for
  instance, to check whether an EVMNS domain name is associated with an EVM address.

This ensures that developers have the same environment when using EVMNS.                                                           |

| 2  | Reverse Registrar                  | [Reverse Registrar](https://github.com/evmns/evmns-contracts/tree/main/contracts/reverseRegistrar) | The reverse resolver in EVMNS provides the ability to declare reverse records. This is a convenient feature that is commonly used to specify address specification names. It can be used to configure records easily.                                                              |

Instead, third-party applications are guided to directly query real-time data within the EVMNS contract on the EOS-EVM to ensure the accuracy of metadata. |
